                What is Solana?
            </p>
            <p>
                Solana is an open source project focused
                on  fast transactions. Users of this
                blockchain network pay their transaction 
                fees with the network's native 
                cryptocurrency SOL.

            <p>
                Solana is a third-generation, proof of 
                Stake blockchain. It has implemented a 
                unique way of creating a trustless system 
                for determining the time of a transaction 
                called Proof of History.<br/> 
                Proof of History 
                differs from the process Bitcoin uses as 
                part of its Proof of Work consensus 
                mechanism.<br />
                Proof of History is a sequence 
                of computation that can provide a way to 
                cryptographically verify passage of time 
                between two events. It uses a 
                cryptographically secure function written 
                so that output cannot be predicted from 
                the input, and must be completely execute
                to generate the output

                <p>
                    Founded in November,2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko from 
                    Solana 
                    Labs, the Solana blockchain adopts a new method of 
                    verifying transactions. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many 
                    other projects suffer from scalability and speed 
                    issues. Using a method known as Proof of History 
                    transactions per second.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Anatoly watched as blockchain systems without clocks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per second worldwide when centralized payment systems such as Visa required peaks of 65,000 tps. Without a clock, it was clear they'd never graduate to being the global payment system or global supercomputer most had dreamed them to be. When Anatoly solved the problem of getting computers that donâ€™t trust each other to agree on time, he knew he had the key to bring 40 years of distributed systems research to the world of blockchain. The resulting cluster wouldn't be just 10 times faster, or a 100 times, or a 1,000 times, but 10,000 times faster, right out of the gate!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anatoly's implementation began in a private codebase and was implemented in the C programming language. Greg Fitzgerald, who had previously worked with Anatoly at semiconductor giant Qualcomm Incorporated, encouraged him to reimplement the project in the Rust programming language. Greg had worked on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, which underlies both the Clang C/C++ compiler as well as the Rust compiler. Greg claimed that the language's safety guarantees would improve software productivity and that its lack of a garbage collector would allow programs to perform as well as those written in C. Anatoly gave it a shot and just two weeks later, had migrated his entire codebase to Rust. Sold. With plans to weave all the world's transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called the project Loom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On February 13th of 2018, Greg began prototyping the first open source implementation of Anatoly's whitepaper. The project was published to GitHub under the name Silk in the loomprotocol organization. On February 28th, Greg made his first release, demonstrating 10 thousand signed transactions could be verified and processed in just over half a second. Shortly after, another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, demonstrated throughput could be massively improved by offloading signature verification to graphics processors. Anatoly recruited Greg, Stephen and three others to co-found a company, then called Loom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around the same time, Ethereum-based project Loom Network sprung up and many people were confused about whether they were the same project. The Loom team decided it would rebrand. They chose the name Solana, a nod to a small beach town North of San Diego called Solana Beach, where Anatoly, Greg and Stephen lived and surfed for three years when they worked for Qualcomm. On March 28th, the team created the Solana GitHub organization and renamed Greg's prototype Silk to Solana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In June of 2018, the team scaled up the technology to run on cloud-based networks and on July 19th, published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second. In a later release in December, called v0.10 Pillbox, the team published a permissioned testnet running 150 nodes on a gigabit network and demonstrated soak tests processing an average of 200 thousand transactions per second with bursts over 500 thousand. The project was also extended to support on-chain programs written in the C programming language and run concurrently in a safe execution environment called BPF.

                        <p>A crypto wallet is a device or application that stores a collection of keys and can be used to send, receive, and track ownership of cryptocurrencies. Wallets can take many forms. A wallet might be a directory or file in your computer's file system, a piece of paper, or a specialized device called a hardware wallet. There are also various smartphone apps and computer programs that provide a user-friendly way to create and manage wallets.

                    By staking your SOL tokens, you help secure the 
                    network and earn rewards while doing so.
                    
                    You can stake by delegating your tokens to 
                    validators who process transactions and run the 
                    network.
                <br/>    
                    Delegating stake is a shared-risk shared-reward 
                    financial model that may provide returns to holders 
                    of tokens delegated for a long period. This is 
                    token-holders (delegators) and the validators to 
                    whom they delegate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more stake delegated to a validator, the more 
                    often this validator is chosen to write new 
                    transactions to the ledger. The more transactions 
                    and its delegators earn. Validators who configure 
                    their systems to be able to process more 
                    transactions earn proportionally more rewards and 
                    smoothly as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Validators incur costs by running and maintaining 
                    their systems, and this is passed on to delegators 
                    in the form of a fee collected as a percentage of 
                    rewards earned. This fee is known as a commission. 
                    delegated to them, they may compete with one another
                    to offer the lowest commission for their services.

                    Solanaâ€™s crypto-economic system is designed to 
                    promote a healthy, long term self-sustaining economy
                    with participant incentives aligned to the security 
                    and decentralization of the network. The main 
                    participants in this economy are validation-clients.
                    Their contributions to the network, state validation
                    , and their requisite incentive mechanisms are 
                    discussed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main channels of participant remittances are referred to as protocol-based rewards and transaction fees. Protocol-based rewards are generated from inflationary issuances from a protocol-defined inflation schedule. These rewards will constitute the total protocol-based reward delivered to validation clients, the remaining sourced from transaction fees. In the early days of the network, it is likely that protocol-based rewards, deployed based on predefined issuance schedule, will drive the majority of participant incentives to participate in the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These protocol-based rewards are calculated per epoch and distributed across the active delegated stake and validator set (per validator commission). As discussed further below, the per annum inflation rate is based on a pre-determined disinflationary schedule. This provides the network with supply predictability which supports long term economic stability and security.

                    An app interacts with a Solana cluster by sending it transactions with one or more instructions. The Solana runtime passes those instructions to programs deployed by app developers beforehand. An instruction might, for example, tell a program to transfer lamports from one account to another or create an interactive contract that governs how lamports are transferred. Instructions are executed sequentially and atomically for each transaction. If any instruction is invalid, all account changes in the transaction are discarded.
